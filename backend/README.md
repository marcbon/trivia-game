## Backend - Full Stack Trivia API 

### Installing Dependencies

1. **PHP 7.4** - Follow instructions to install the required version of php for your platform in the [php manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/image.installation.php).
2. **Installing requirements** - To install dependencies, navigate to the `/backend/api` directory and run:

```bash
composer install
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `composer.json` file.

3. **Configure environment**

If you like to change the environment for the project, you can do that by editing the file `.env` in the root folder, but we suggest to keep the same set variables.

4. **Key Dependencies**

 - [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
 - [Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail#introduction)
 - [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 - [WSL2 base engine for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) - Windows

### Docker Setup

Once your WSL distro (i.e. Ubuntu-16.04) is correctly installed and integrated with Docker, navigate to the `/backend/api` directory and run:

```bash
wsl
```

This command will open the terminal for the installed and enabled wsl distro.

Start docker engine (Docker Desktop for Windows).

From the terminal, run:

```bash
vendor/bin/sail up
```

This will initiate the sail engine and install all the requirements (this will take up to few minutes, just for the first time) to create and run the needed Docker containers specified in the file `docker-compose.yml` file.

This, will create two containers named `api_psql` and `api_laravel`. 

### Database Setup

`DB_DATABASE` is a variable found in the `.env` file previously configured, a database with this name will be created in the Docker image by the `vendor/bin/sail up` command.
You can now connect to the database with the `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` credentials.

##### Import database dump

In order to have the database filled with data to run the application, you need to import the database dump placed in the `/backend` folder to the Docker container.

To do this, run:

```bash
docker ps
```

Get the **CONTAINER ID** for the `api_psql` container.

Use this id into the following command:

```bash
docker cp /host/local/path/file/api-export.psql <containerId>:/tmp
```

This way, you will copy the databse dump file into the Docker container. 

Access the `api_psql` Docker container bash, and run:

```bash
su postgres
```

Navigate to the /tmp folder, there you will find your copied database dump.

To import this dump into your database, run:

```
psql databasename < api-export.psql
```

Where `databasename` is the name specified in the `DB_DATABASE` variable in the `.env` file.

Now that your Docker containers are up, you are able to access the Laravel app from http://localhost.

## API endpoints

This section will describe all the API endpoints, with the structure of each request and all the data required and returned.

All the endpoints are served under: http://localhost/api/v1/.
